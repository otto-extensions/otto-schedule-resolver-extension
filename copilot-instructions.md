# Otto Schedule Resolver Extension Instructions

## Architectural Principles
- Extensions MUST NOT define API or CLI commands.
- All commands MUST be routed through the Otto Command Service Layer.
- Any attempt to bypass the CSL will be rejected automatically.
- If coding requires external access, generate ONLY internal commands and rely on the command service layer to expose CLI/API surfaces.

## Forbidden Actions
- Do not implement HTTP routes, REST handlers, GraphQL handlers, or server entrypoints in this repository.
- Do not add CLI parsers, shell command surfaces, or direct process argument parsing.
- Do not expose external API/CLI surfaces from extension modules.

## Command Generation Rules
- Keep schedule workflows behind internal command definitions only.
- Execute internal commands only through commandService.run(commandName, payload).
- Keep command payloads deterministic and command-service compatible.

## Extension Development Rules
- Keep code scoped to providers, services, and internal commands.
- Persist schedule metadata with deterministic formats.
- Fail clearly when required command-service context is missing.
